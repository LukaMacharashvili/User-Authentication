# User-Auth
Jwt user authentication project created with Node.js and Angular (MEAN Stack). Implemented functionalities: Registration, Authorization, LogOut, User Info Update, User Delete, Forgot Password and Email Verification via Email. Built With: Node.js, Express.js, Angular, MongoDB, JWT, Passport, Cloudinary.
I used Node-Mailer for Email Verification and Password reset functionality and I also used helmet and express-rate-limit to add a little bit of security to the project.
